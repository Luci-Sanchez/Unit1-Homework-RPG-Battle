# RPG battle simulator :mage: :crossed_swords: :elf_woman: :joystick: 

You can play in our RPG battle simulator, where you can create a party of warriors and wizards to fight other parties to determine the winner. 
We have two types of characters, warriors and wizards who have different attributes and combat styles:

- WARRIORS are strong well armored characters that focus on the attribute strength. Every round a warrior will try to do a “Heavy attack”. 
  The  damage of a heavy attack is equals to their strength and every hit will decrease their stamina by 5 points. If he can’t make a heavy attack   he will do a “Weak attack”. The damage of a weak attack is the half of the strength. Every weak attack will recover his stamina by 1.
  
- WIZARDS are the masters of the arcane their main attribute is intelligence. Every round a wizard will try to cast a “Fireball”. The damage of a     fireball is equals to his intelligence and every fireball will decrease their mana by 5 points. If he can’t cast a fireball he will do a “Staff     hit”. The damage of a staff hit is equals to 2. Every staff hit will recover his mana by 1.

Game RULES:

- The characters are grouped in parties and the battle is between 2 parties. So before the battle could start you need to add warriors or wizards     in both parties (could be mixed with warriors and wizards).

- The battles are 1 vs 1. So you can choose between members of the party to duel another member from the rival party.

- The battle is by rounds, in each round both combatants attack at the same time (so you even if one combatant do the killing blow both will take     damage). So the combat could end in a tie.

- When the battle is over the winner return to the party and the loser is removed and sent to the graveyard. Then you can choose the                 combatants for the next duel.

- When a party loose all their members, a winner party is declared.

ENJOY PLAYING!!
